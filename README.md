## VectorDB and Storage

We use [LanceDB](https://lancedb.com/) as our vector store. Vectors and metadata are stored locally.

To avoid scraping RSS feeds multiple times, we cache scraped html data to disk and log the scraping activity to [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/docs/guides/python/install) locally.
